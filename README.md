User-eXperience-Focused Dattorro Reverb
=====

Parameterization of [DattorroReverbNode](https://github.com/khoin/DattorroReverbNode) with focus on UX.

## Purpose

In the use-case of packaging a reverb for musicians, some parameters of the Dattorro reverb are not needed. This repository is a modification of [DattorroReverbNode](https://github.com/khoin/DattorroReverbNode) where some parameters are merged for that use-case.
